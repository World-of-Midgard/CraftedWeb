<h3>How do I connect to the server?</h3>
We have an excellent connection guide for you to follow <a href="?p=connect" title="Connection Guide">here</a>. If you have problems with your installation though, please refer to our <a href="/forum/" title="Forum">Forum</a>.<br/>&nbsp;

<h3>Why do I have so high MS?</h3>
Your latency may depend on several things. Our server is located in Germany. If you live far away, you may have slightly higher latency than other people. <br/>
But for any other problems, please refer to your ISP's support, you could always try to ask us at the <a href="/forum/" title="Forum">Forum</a>, but we may not be able to help you with all of your problems.<br/>&nbsp;

<h3>How does voting work?</h3>
Voting helps the server to get more traffic to our website, which will result in more players joining the server. It's very easy to vote, and you will be awarded with Vote Points which you may spend on in-game items using our <a href="?p=voteshop" title="Vote Shop">Vote Shop</a>. <i>Don't know how to vote?</i> Please check out our short Voting guide <a href="/?p=howtovote" title="Voting Guide">here</a>.<br/>
